<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Password of Read Only User</h2>
<p>Password to access all server as read only user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hosts Read Only User</h2>
<p>IP addresses allowed to access Mysql databases and web services as read only user (leave empty to allow access from everywhere).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Path Inventory Directory</h2>
<p>Directory in Mysql server where system will put SQL generated files to execute connecting to localhost Mysql service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Directories to search exes</h2>
<p>List of Directories in nodes (separated by white spaces) where system will search executable files</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Directories not to search exes</h2>
<p>List of Directories in nodes (separated by white spaces) to exclude from previous list. System will not search executable files inside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Config Scan Openvas</h2>
<p>Predefined scan configuration of Openvas checks. Available options are: 'Discovery', 'Host Discovery', 'System Discovery', 'Full and fast', 'Full and fast ultimate', 'Full and very deep' and 'Full and very deep ultimate'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Openvas Crontab</h2>
<p>Crontab settings to define Openvas frequency checks. 'Month' was defined as a required parameter in Configuration System, so here we have to define: minutes, hours, day and weekday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Database Update Openvas Crontab</h2>
<p>Crontab settings to define Openvas database Updates frequency checks. We have to define: minutes, hours, day, month and weekday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Exclude Openvas Servers List</h2>
<p>List of hosts (separated by white spaces) to exclude of Openvas checks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Do you want to create Openvas Special Group?</h2>
<p>Script ask to create a special group of hosts with a different Openvas frequency check (could be bigger or smaller than the general frequency).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Openvas Special Servers List</h2>
<p>List of host (separated by white spaces) that belongs to Openvas Special Group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Openvas Special Group Crontab</h2>
<p>Crontab settings to define Openvas Special Group frequency checks. We have to define: minutes, hours, day, month and weekday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Frequency to export data from Munin to InfluxDB</h2>
<p>How often (in minutes) MuninInfluxDB exports data from Munin to InfluxDB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After questions, answers will be shown in a summary screen and ask to continue or cancel the script.</p>
<p>If continue answer has been selected, script will modify System Configuration and reload crontab setting if we have modified any crontab parameter, or reconfigure munininfluxdb if MuninInfluxDB frequency has been modified.</p>
