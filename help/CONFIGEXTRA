              Extra Configuration Guide 
######################################################


We can configure extra parameters executing '/etc/ansible/configExtra.py' python script, or from menu '/etc/ansible/menu.py' choice 'option 2. Configure Extra Variables'.

Configuration start with several questions about extra parameters of system.

  
These are extra parameters:


* 'Path Inventory Directory' -> Directory in Mysql server where system will put SQL generated files to execute connecting to localhost Mysql service.


* 'Directories to search exes' -> List of Directories in nodes (separated by white spaces) where system will search executable files


* 'Directories not to search exes' -> List of Directories in nodes (separated by white spaces) to exclude from previous list. System will not search executable files inside.


* 'Config Scan Openvas' -> Predefined scan configuration of Openvas checks. Available options are: 'Discovery', 'Host Discovery', 'System Discovery', 'Full and fast', 'Full and fast ultimate', 'Full and very deep' and 'Full and very deep ultimate'.


* 'Openvas Crontab' -> Crontab settings to define Openvas frequency checks. 'Month' was defined as a required parameter in Configuration System, so here we have to define: minutes, hours, day and weekday.


* 'Database Update Openvas Crontab' -> Crontab settings to define Openvas database Updates frequency checks. We have to define: minutes, hours, day, month and weekday.


* 'Exclude Openvas Servers List' -> List of hosts (separated by white spaces) to exclude of Openvas checks.


* 'Do you want to create Openvas Special Group?' -> Script ask to create a special group of hosts with a different Openvas frequency checks (could be bigger or smaller than the general frequency).


* 'Openvas Special Servers List' -> List of host (separated by white spaces) that belongs to Openvas Special Group.


* 'Openvas Special Group Crontab' -> Crontab settings to defeinde Openvas Special Group frequency checks. We have to define: minutes, hours, day, month and weekday.


After questions, answers will be shown in a summary screen and ask to continue or cancel the script.


If continue answer has been selected, script will modify System Configuration and reload crontab setting if we have modified any crontab parameter.
