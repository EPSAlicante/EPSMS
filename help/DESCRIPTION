<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EPS Monitoring System is able to get information about software, hardware, (even about security) from selected hosts (in some selected networks).</p>
<p>This information will be saved in some servers in different formats (including a mysql database, a dokuwiki server and PHP & angularjs applications), to be accesed by administrators (with user/password security) from some selected IPs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it will install and configure an alerts system (Nagios) and a performance system (Munin), save their data in a time-series database (InfluxDB), and show information collected with metric & analytic dahsboards (Grafana).</p>
<p>This infrastructure will be deployed after a simple configuration (some variables to define) and will be updated forever with no human interaction. Administrator just have to install control software (really simple), and configure it to deploy infrastructure.</p>
<p>Configuration consists on a number of questions to define parameters needed for deployment, security, maintenance and non interaction updating.</p>
<p>After configuration, system will scan working networks (defined at configuration) to detect hosts. For every host, system will try to access inside and clasify them as 'nodes', 'winNodes' or 'outsiders'. Linux/Unix accesible hosts will be clasified as 'nodes', Windows accesible hosts will be clasified as 'winNodes', and not accesible hosts will be 'outsiders'.</p>
<p>There are four stages for using system:</p>
<h2>(1) Configuration</h2>
<p>Execute menu '/etc/ansible/menu.py' and select <a href="menu.html#1">option 1 'Configure System'</a>.</p>
<p>We have to answer some questions about system. These answers are basic for deployment. At the end, deployment starts.</p>
<p>We can reconfigure system at any time using the same menu option.</p>
<p>See <a href="configure.html">Configuration</a> document for details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>(2) Deployment</h2>
<p>When System has been configured, it automatically will start installation and configuration of infrastructure, required servers and tools to start data collection, monitorization and results checking.</p>
<p>Servers and tools installed and configured at deployment are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control server with Ansible and all required tools to deploy the rest of infrastructure, scanning working subnets and system management.</li>
<li>Mysql server configured with inventory database to save information collected from hosts.</li>
<li>Nagios server to check hosts: nodes (monitoring load, disk free space and TCP and UDP open ports) and outsiders (monitoring TCP open ports).</li>
<li>Munin server with performance graphics about main hosts' features.</li>
<li>Wiki server with data inventory collected from hosts (nodes and outsiders).</li>
<li>MuninInfluxdb software to get new munin data automatically and save into influxdb database.</li>
<li>Graphios software to get new nagios data automatically and save into influxdb database.</li>
<li>Influx server configured with munin and nagios databases to save information collected from Nagios and Munin.</li>
<li>Grafana server configured with dashboards to show graphical information from Influx databases.</li>
<li>Openvas server to check vulnerabilities of hosts and generate reports (html, pdf, txt and xml formats) in Wiki server. It also has a Web server in port 9392 to manage task and watch reports.</li>
<li>Web server with PHP & Angulajs Apps and REST API for querys and management from data collected, and PHPMyAdmin to query data and manage database.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these tasks are repeated frequently (defined at configuration time) to verify that all servers are installed and configured correctly. If something has changed, Control server will install and configure again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>(3) Data collection</h2>
<p>When infrastructure is deployed (all server and nodes have their software installed and configured), system is ready to start data collection stage.</p>
<p>This stage consists of some tasks that Control server will repeat frequently (defined at configuration time too):</p>
<ul>
<li>It starts a scanning of working subnets (defined at configuration time) to detect hosts and classify them as nodes (if control server can access host with defined user) or outsiders (if control server can't access).</li>
<li>When scanning is done Control server will prepare an inventory of nodes with open TCP open ports of every host (scanning will give us a list of TCP open ports for every node). An inventory of outsiders with TCP open ports will be made too.</li>
<li>Control server will save this information (nodes, outsiders and their TCP ports) is saved on 'inventory' database.</li>
<li>Control server will generate the main wiki page 'servers' with information about nodes and outsiders detected, a page for every host with their TCP ports, and reports of vulnerabilities checked.</li>
<li>Control server will configure Nagios server with nodes and outsider as hosts, checking TCP open ports.</li>
<li>Control server will connect to nodes to install and configure required software to monitor (Nagios NRPE), get graphics performance (Munin node) and some other tools to recover hardware and software information.</li>
<li>Collection of hardware and software information from nodes.</li>
<li>Control server will save all data collected on 'inventory' database.</li>
<li>Control server will generate wiki pages with collected information and data from 'inventory' database (pages with historic information).</li>
<li>Control server will configure Nagios server with internal checks (with Nagios NRPE) as load, disk free space and TCP & UDP open ports.</li>
<li>Control server will configure Munin server with nodes.</li> 
<li>Control server will check vulnerabilities of all hosts (outsiders, nodes and winNodes) with Openvas software. It generates a report (in different format: html, pdf, txt and xml) for every host (this information will be available in wiki pages and stored on 'inventory' database).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>(4) Monitorization and results checking</h2>
<p>When system has configured all server and nodes, and has collected all information about nodes and outsiders, administrators are ready to use it.</p>
<p>Obviously, deployment and data collection stages will repeat forever to maintain infrastructure ready and data updated.</p>
<p>Administrators will use these tools connecting to servers (Nagios server for monitorizarion of hosts, Munin server to get graphical performance of nodes, Grafana server to analize information with dahsboards, Wiki server to get information about hosts and Web server to manage database and doing simple queries with PHP & Angularjs applications) just from a list of selected IPs or everywhere (defined at configuration time).</p>
<p>They will connect using user 'admin' with password defined at configuration time.</p>
<p>A read only user can be created to access all server just to read information. At extra variables configuration, user name and password could be defined, and a list of selected IP (or everywhere) to access servers.</p>
<p>Results can be monitored through <strong>Web Menu</strong> (https://WebServer).</p>
<p>There's a menu with next options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main Panel

<p><h3>Nagios server</h3></p>
<p>Connecting to Nagios server permit monitoring hosts, open TCP & UDP ports (just TCP for outsiders), check load and space free of root disk for nodes, and check system errors.</p>
<p>We can see availability of hosts and services, receiving alerts about any problems.</p>
<p>It's an essential tool for Administrators to be alerted immediately about problems and repairing them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Obviously, Administrator can increase availability of hosts and services reducing time discovering and resolving problems.</p>
<p>Of course, administrator can modify Nagios to add new checks for nodes, increasing capacities for monitorization (see <a href="/help/faq.html#G1" target="_blank">FAQ</a> for details) Administrator can connnect to URL: http://NagiosServer/nagios</p>
<p><h3>Munin server</h3></p>
<p>Connecting to Munin server permit watch graphical performance of nodes main features as: performance I/O of disks, free space (%) of disks, network interfaces bandwith, number of processes, CPU, load system, users logged, memory, Swap, etc.</p>
<p>It's very useful tool to monitor performance of hosts after an error, trying to discover the origin of problem. Munin server will save information about performance for a year, and user can select range time even zooming in and out to increase or decrease parformance graphical range.</p>
<p>Of course, administrator can modify Munin to add new graphs for nodes, increasing capacities to monitor performance. Administrator can connect to URL: http://MuninServer/munin</p>
<p><h3>Grafana server</h3></p>
<p>Connecting to Grafana server permit watch metrics and analytics dashboards with graphics, alerts, data tables, etc. with munin and nagios data saved in a influxdb database as time-series.</p>
<p>Grafana permit create, edit, import/export and share fully interactive and configurable graphs. By default, a dahsboard will be generated for every node or outsider.</p>
<p>After generation, user can modify dashboards generated or create new ones. If a generated dahsboard is deleted, it will be generated again by Control server.</p>
<p>Administrator can connect to URL: http://WebServer/grafana</p>
<p><h3>Openvas server</h3></p>
<p>Connecting to Openvas server permit manage Openvas: targets, tasks, updates... generate and watch reports of scanned hosts. Vulnerabilities checks and are made by Control server automatically, and reports are created and copied to Wiki server.</p>
<p>But with Openvas server manually checks can be created.</p>
<p>Administrator can connect to URL: http://WebServer/openvas</p>
<p><h3>Web server</h3></p>
<p>Connecting to Web server permit manage database with PhpMyAdmin software. We'll need mysql user ('root' or 'admin') and password (defined at configuration time).</p>
<p>Administrator can connect to URL: http://WebServer/phpmyadmin</p>
<p>We can watch a few examples of PHP and Angulajs applications and take it as templates to made customized appplications.</p>
<p>Administrator can connect to URL: http://WebServer/web</p>
<p><h3>Wiki server (inventory)</h3></p>
<p>Connecting to Wiki server permit get hardware & software information about hosts (just availability, TCP open ports and vulnerabilities for outsiders).</p>
<p>Main page show a list of hosts: nodes, winNodes (windows nodes) and outsiders. We can ordering columns clicking on top of them. We can filter type of hosts (nodes, winNodes and outsiders) clicking in selected host type.</p>
<p>We have possibility to see changes on availability of hosts (discovering down time of them) clicking on 'Last 100 changes' column. Clicking on hostname column we'll see all information about it (host's page).</p>
<p>We can also watch vulnerabilities scanning of hosts, and a link to Nagios and Munin servers page. In host's page we'll see hardware, software and security information (for nodes and winNodes).</p>
<p>Information about nodes and winNodes is similar but not exactly the same. We'll have this information about nodes:</p>
